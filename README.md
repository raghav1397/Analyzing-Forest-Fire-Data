# Analyzing Forest Fire Data

When it comes to understanding forest fires and what can be done to manage them, it is helpful to have an idea of when the fires are most likely to occur.

Take a look at the data. Which variables can help you understand when forest fires tend to occur?

There are two variables that have to do with time: month and day. We can ask the questions:

    During which months are forest fires most common?
    On which days of the week are forest fires most common?

To answer these questions, create two bar charts:

    One showing the number of forest fires occuring during each month
    Another showing the number of forest fires occurring on each day of the week
